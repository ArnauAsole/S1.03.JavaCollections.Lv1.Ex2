# (0️⃣1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣4️⃣) Exercise Description

The purpose of this exercise is to work with Java collections, specifically `List<Integer>`, and practice traversing and manipulating lists using the `ListIterator` interface.

### ✅ What You Must Implement

#### 🔹 List Creation
- Create a `List<Integer>` and populate it with several integer values (e.g., 1 to 5).
- Print the original list to confirm the content.

#### 🔹 Reverse Copy
- Create a second `List<Integer>`.
- Use a `ListIterator` starting from the **end** of the first list to traverse it **in reverse**.
- Add each element to the second list as it's read from the iterator.

#### 🔹 Output
- Print the second list to confirm the values appear in reversed order compared to the first list.

This exercise is designed to practice **list manipulation**, **iterators**, and working with the Java Collections Framework.
